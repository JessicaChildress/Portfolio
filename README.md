# Jessica Childress Project Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this Repository is to serves as a portfolio showcasing my unique skillset through various data science projects:

1. Thesis Unknotting Neural Network
  * This project is a culmination of work from Spring 2023 thorugh fall 2023 (not completed yet!) Building off of a popular problem from knot theory, I am working with professor Eric Hogle at Gonzaga University as part of my Thesis and Honors Capstone in order to develop a neural network that can identify the difference between an unknot and a knot on very large mosaic grids. 
  * SKILLS: Python, Data Generation, Knot Theory, Statistics, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Network,
  * LIBRARIES: numpy, pandas, pillow

2. Stroke Prediction Using SVM.
  * SKILLS: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Cleaning and Visualization, Support Vector Machines, ML optimization
  * LIBRARIES: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
